# Output Template — design-system.md

Produce a file with this structure. Adapt section names to the site, but keep the overall shape. The goal: an AI reading this file alone can generate on-brand pages.

```markdown
# Design System — <Site Name> (<domain>)

> Extracted from <page> source on <date>. Source: <stack, e.g. WordPress + Elementor>.
> Visual identity: <one-paragraph vibe summary — dominant colors, mood, what kind of product>.
> This file is written to be fed to an AI to generate new pages/apps in the same style. Tokens note where they're used on the original site.

## 1. Color Palette
### Brand / Global
| Role | Hex | Notes / Usage |
### Backgrounds / Surfaces
| Hex | Usage |
### Accents / Text-on-color
| Hex | Usage |
### Signature Gradients
- <name>: <full gradient> — <where used>
### Palette summary
```<compact list grouped by family>```

## 2. Typography
(Full fonts section per fonts-guide.md: family, full stack, source, all weights, weight→role table, import code.)
### Type scale
| Token | Desktop | Mobile | Usage |

## 3. Spacing & Layout
(container max-widths, gaps, section paddings, column layouts, base unit)
### Container tokens
```<vars>```

## 4. Borders, Radius & Shadows
(radius, shadow approach — flag if minimal, transitions)

## 5. Buttons
(background, size, style, link treatment)

## 6. Components Observed
(hero, feature rows, stat blocks, carousels, footer, nav, etc.)

## 7. Responsive Breakpoints
```<breakpoint list>```
(what changes at each)

## 8. Style Direction (for AI generation)
Numbered, concrete do/don't principles for cloning the look.
### Copy-paste CSS variables
```css
:root { /* all key tokens as variables */ }
```
```

## Rules
- Fill tables with REAL values from source; never placeholders.
- Mark low-confidence/missing data explicitly (e.g. "shadows: none observed", "weights inferred").
- Keep the visual-identity summary punchy and accurate — it anchors the AI's generation.
- The `:root` block and the Style Direction section are the two most useful parts for downstream generation; make them strong.
